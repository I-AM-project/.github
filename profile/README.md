# I-AM-Project 
*Welcome to the I-AM Project*
---

## Mission Statment 
> The mission of this open source project is to develop a verifiable data registry
solution that organizations can deploy, which will provide their individuals
(employees, customers, citizens, etc.) with decentralized identity using W3C
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),while providing
the organization with greater security and other benefits. This is expected to
include (for the individual or legal entity) an open source digital wallet, edge
agent, and a cloud agent designed to serve as a secure Personal Data System
(PDS). This project will develop and publish one or more governance
frameworks, which organizations can further refine. All components will align to
support organizational Zero Trust objectives and enable the developing principles
of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).
