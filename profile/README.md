# Mission Statment 
From Linux Foundation IAM Project charter:
> "The mission of this open source project is to develop a verifiable data registry
solution that organizations can deploy, which will provide their individuals
(employees, customers, citizens, etc.) with decentralized identity using W3C
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),while providing
the organization with greater security and other benefits. This is expected to
include (for the individual or legal entity) an open source digital wallet, edge
agent, and a cloud agent designed to serve as a secure Personal Data System
(PDS). This project will develop and publish one or more governance
frameworks, which organizations can further refine. All components will align to
support organizational Zero Trust objectives and enable the developing principles
of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)."

## IAM-Project Teams 
Organization-focused Team: This team will develop generic solutions for organizations (that need high security), which will include SSI capabilities for their members (employees, customers, citizens). Join [here.](https://github.com/orgs/I-AM-project/teams/organization-focused-team) 

SSI-Focused Team: This team (of SSI-advocates) will develop, test, and deploy an SSI-optimized blockchain and digital wallet. Deployment will be in collaboration with an external organization.  The goal is for the first blockchain to be good enough for organizations needing limited security, then to move upmarket to higher security versions.   If you are an advocate for self-sovergn identity, personal data control, or online privacy, please join us [here](https://github.com/orgs/I-AM-project/teams/ssi-focused-team).
