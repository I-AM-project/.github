# Mission Statment 
: From Linux Foundation IAM Project charter:
> "The mission of this open source project is to develop a verifiable data registry
solution that organizations can deploy, which will provide their individuals
(employees, customers, citizens, etc.) with decentralized identity using W3C
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),while providing
the organization with greater security and other benefits. This is expected to
include (for the individual or legal entity) an open source digital wallet, edge
agent, and a cloud agent designed to serve as a secure Personal Data System
(PDS). This project will develop and publish one or more governance
frameworks, which organizations can further refine. All components will align to
support organizational Zero Trust objectives and enable the developing principles
of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)."

## IAM-Project Teams 
Organization-focused Team: This team will develop generic solutions for organizations (that need high security), which will include SSI capabilities for their members (employees, customers, citizens).  

SSI-Focused Team
: This team (of SSI-advocates) will help the above team fulfill as many principles of SSI as possible. It will also explore, develop, test, and pilot alternate solutions that meet all principles of SSI, as well as assess those developed by others.  Join us at [SSI-focused Team](https://github.com/orgs/I-AM-project/teams/ssi-focused).
