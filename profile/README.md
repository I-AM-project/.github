### This is a Linux Foundation Project. 
# Goals and Objectives (Find your passion, join, and help!)

<br/>

|  | Goal-1: Organizations achieve goals of Zero Trust | Goal-2: Individuals collect and share credentials and data, privately.  |Goal-3: Organizations help members establish and govern their digital lives | Goal-4: Individuals accept, integrate, and use data from vendors. | Goal-5: Vendors gain new customers from individual early adopters | Goal-6: Governments pass data privacy laws because enough voters call for them. |

# Mission Statement 
From Linux Foundation IAM Project charter:
> "The mission of this open source project is to develop a verifiable data registry
solution that organizations can deploy, which will provide their individuals
(employees, customers, citizens, etc.) with decentralized identity using W3C
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),while providing
the organization with greater security and other benefits. This is expected to
include (for the individual or legal entity) an open source digital wallet, edge
agent, and a cloud agent designed to serve as a secure Personal Data System
(PDS). This project will develop and publish one or more governance
frameworks, which organizations can further refine. All components will align to
support organizational Zero Trust objectives and enable the developing principles
of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)."  [See IAM-Project Documents Repository](https://github.com/I-AM-project/Overall-Project-Documents)

## IAM-Project Teams 
Organization-focused Team: This team will develop generic solutions for organizations (that need high security), which will include SSI capabilities for their members (employees, customers, citizens). 

SSI-Focused Team: This team (of SSI-advocates) will develop, test, and deploy an SSI-optimized solution. Deployment will be in collaboration with an external organization.  The first goal is for a solution good enough for organizations needing only limited security, and then we'll work on higher security versions.   If you are an advocate for self-sovergn identity, personal data control, or online privacy, please join this team by emailing james.schoening@ieee.org.
