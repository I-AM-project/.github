# I-AM-Project 
*Welcome to the I-AM Project*

## Mission Statment 
> The mission of this open source project is to develop a verifiable data registry
solution that organizations can deploy, which will provide their individuals
(employees, customers, citizens, etc.) with decentralized identity using W3C
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs),while providing
the organization with greater security and other benefits. This is expected to
include (for the individual or legal entity) an open source digital wallet, edge
agent, and a cloud agent designed to serve as a secure Personal Data System
(PDS). This project will develop and publish one or more governance
frameworks, which organizations can further refine. All components will align to
support organizational Zero Trust objectives and enable the developing principles
of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

## Project Structures
Organization-Focused
: TODO

SSI-Focused
: This SSI-focused project will run in parallel to the Organization-Focused project. It will develop and implement a series of prototype 'decentralized' Blockchain networks, with each version better meeting the needs of more organizations. We expect the Organization-Focused project to trade off SSI principles to achieved needed security. This SSI-Focus project will take longer, but will eventually meet those same organizational requirements, but while also meeting the principles of SSI. Interested collaborators should join this project or join the [SSI Focused Team](https://github.com/orgs/I-AM-project/teams/ssi-focused).
